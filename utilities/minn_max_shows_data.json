The game was developed by AlphaDream, who went on to develop the Mario & Luigi series, but Nintendo never released it in English. Hanson and Demille review Tomato Adventure, talk about the game's highlights, and what makes it stand out as a great and bizarre comedic RPG in the same vein as Mother 3.

A lot of us only know The Oregon Trail gameplay from the Apple II, but its true groundbreaking origins go back so much earlier. Since the documentary is about the power of teaching, programming, and selflessness, we've bundled the documentary with a charity drive for New Vision Foundation.

Started in 2015 by Jade Raymond, EA Motive was created to fill the gap in EA's library of creating an action-focused open-world game like Assassin's Creed or Batman. Throughout the last five years there have been job postings and teases (including a stretch of time that included the designer of Portal Kim Swift), but very few details about this mysterious project.

This week we're finally getting into the meat of the podcast. In our first real episode, we discuss AFI's first full-length album from 1995 called Answer That And Stay Fashionable.
